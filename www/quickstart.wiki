This a short howto explaining the use of the Convertor. Just follow it and
in 3 minutes you can convert units back and forth..

Fire up the application, and it should resemble the next image (see the red numbers
for the description that follows):
<img class="scrnsht" src="conv-layout.png">
  1.  On this paticular image, the conversion is done from the left input box
      to the right, and the category and unit lists are visible. The direction
      of conversion is determined by placing the mouse in one of the input boxes.

  2.  The left list is the category list. Click on a category and the unit list
      will change accordingly.

  3.  The right list is the unit list in each category. Left click on a unit will
      choose that unit for the left input box, right click on a unit will choose
      that unit for the right input box.

  4.  Click this long button and the two lists will hide. Another click will show
      them again.

When the lists are hidden the Converter window takes minimum screen real estate.
The next image shows the Convertor with the lists hidden.

On this image the conversion is done from right to left, notice the green arrow 
has changed direction. Also visible is the popup menu which pops whenever the
right mouse button is clicked (but not when the mouse is over the unit list). 
The options are:
  *  <b>Stay on top</b> - Convertor will stay on top of other program windows.
  *  <b>Auto close units</b> - The units will auto hide when clicking in one 
     of the input boxes.
  *  <b>About</b> - Well, about...
