Convertor is written in object pascal, and is using the 
[http://www.freepascal.org | free pascal] compiler and the
[http://lazarus.freepascal.org | Lazarus] widgets and library. So first go
ahead and install Lazarus, it will install fpc with it.

Now there are two options:
  #  The source code (and this web site..) is managed with a distributed source
     control program called [http://www.fossil-scm.org | fossil]. It is very easy
     to use and I really like it. Anyhow, go and download it, put it on the path,
     and then get the whole repository with:
     <pre>fossil clone http://convertor.moosht.org/ myconvertor.fossil</pre>
  #  Download the latest source code from the [/timeline | timeline] page. Click
     on the artifact ID, and then download the source code as zip or tarball.
     Uncompress..
     
Open 'convertor.lpi' with lazarus, and compile. finito..
