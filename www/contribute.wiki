Many things still need to be done:
  *  Create icons specifically for Convertor. At the moment all the graphics
     were gathered from the web.
  *  Streamline the code a little bit. This is my first attempt with object pascal
     (or with object anything) after all...
  *  Maybe replace the unit TListBox with TStringGrid, which should make unit
     choosing easier.
  *  Add more units and categories. Now anyone can do that - just follow the guidelines
     in the UnitData.xml file, and send the file back to me.
  *  Something else I forgot?!?
