## Description

This is a small and unobtrusive unit converter. It is in fact a study in minimalism and effective UI design. Check out [highlights + quickstart](quickstart.md) for a short howto.

## Build

Convertor is written in object pascal, and is using the [free pascal](http://www.freepascal.org) compiler and the [lazarus](http://lazarus.freepascal.org) widgets and library. So first go ahead and install Lazarus, it will install fpc with it.

  1. Install lazarus on your system.
  2. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/hdrz/convertor) and open convertor.lpi in lazarus.
  3. Compile.

## Note

This is the first program I ever wrote in object pascal (or any language), so the style and logic are not the best you can find...
